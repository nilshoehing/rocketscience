# RocketScience

Evaluation Code for the RocketScience benchmark. It's designed to run in Google Colab, but we also include a requirements.txt in case you want to run in locally.

The code downloads the dataset automatically, but it is also available here: https://huggingface.co/datasets/nilshoehing/rocketsciencebench
